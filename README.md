# 🌐 The Zeitgeist Pet

> A "living" digital entity that evolves every hour based on the real-time state of the internet. A Data-Tamagotchi that you don't feed with food, but with global data.

![Zeitgeist Pet Banner](https://pollinations.ai/p/A%20glowing%20digital%20creature%20made%20of%20data%20streams%20and%20API%20connections%20floating%20in%20a%20cyberpunk%20void%20surrounded%20by%20stock%20charts%20weather%20patterns%20and%20news%20headlines?width=1200&height=400&nologo=true)

## 🎮 What is This?

The Zeitgeist Pet is a unique web experience where a digital entity's mood, appearance, and personality are determined entirely by real-world data:

- **📈 Crypto markets** - Bitcoin crashes make it sick; bull runs make it euphoric
- **🌦️ Global weather** - Storms bring anxiety; sunshine brings joy
- **📰 News sentiment** - Headlines shape its worldview
- **🌌 Cosmic events** - NASA's Picture of the Day influences its philosophy
- **🌍 Earthquakes** - Seismic activity makes the whole site shake
- **☀️ Solar cycles** - It follows the sun's rhythm in a random world capital

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 The Chaos Engine
A central Node.js brain that fetches data from **20 free APIs** and normalizes it into a "Vibe Score" (0-100).

### 🎭 Dynamic Personality
- **10 distinct moods** from "Despairing" (0-10) to "Transcendent" (91-100)
- Unique thoughts and philosophical musings based on current state
- Daily-changing avatar generated by Robohash
- Spirit Pokemon companion that matches the day's energy

### 🕹️ User Interaction
- **Comfort Button** - Soothe the entity and boost its mood
- **Agitate Button** - Poke it and watch chaos unfold
- If 10,000 people agitate... **RAVE MODE ACTIVATES** 🎉

### 📸 Shareable Mood Cards
Generate daily mood cards to share on social media. "How is the internet feeling today?"

### 🧠 Brain Scan
Tech users can view the raw JSON data: see exactly what's influencing the entity's mood.

### ⚰️ The Graveyard
An archive of the entity's historical forms. Remember "The Day Bitcoin Crashed"?
